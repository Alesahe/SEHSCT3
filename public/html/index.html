                Vivid Hills is based in our warm and welcoming home in Baulkham Hills. 
                Our space is designed for safety and exploration, with a dedicated play area filled 
                with age-appropriate toys and resources. We also have a newly renovated backyard where 
                children enjoy outdoor play, gardening and nature exploration.
                <br><br>
                As a family, we value safety, kindness, respect and open communication. I involve my husband and
                two children in the day care, creating a supportive environment where your child(ren) will feel
                like part of our family. 
                <br><br>
                We love sharing our interests, which include role-playing, arts and crafts,
                sensory activities, music, dancing, reading, STEM and outdoor activities, which are incorporated into 
                daily activities.
